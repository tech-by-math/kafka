# Real-time Analytics Pipeline

## Overview
Process millions of user interactions in real-time to power recommendation engines and business dashboards using Kafka's distributed streaming capabilities.

## Business Problem
**Challenge**: E-commerce platform needs to process 100,000+ user events per second for immediate personalization and analytics.

## Mathematical Foundation
```
Throughput Target: 100,000 events/second
Latency SLA: 95% of events processed within 100ms
Partition Strategy: 12 partitions for parallel processing
Per-Partition Rate: 100,000 ÷ 12 ≈ 8,333 events/second
```

## Architecture
```
Web App → Kafka Topics → Stream Processing → Analytics DB
Mobile App ↗         ↘ ML Pipeline → Recommendation API
IoT Sensors          ↘ Alerting System → Notifications
```

## Key Topics
- **user-clicks** (12 partitions, 1-day retention)
- **user-purchases** (6 partitions, 7-day retention)  
- **sensor-data** (24 partitions, 1-hour retention)

## Simplified Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion
```java
// High-throughput producer configuration
props.put("batch.size", 16384);
props.put("linger.ms", 10);
props.put("compression.type", "lz4");
props.put("acks", "1");  // Balance performance/durability
```

### 2. Stream Processing
```java
// Real-time aggregation with 5-minute windows
clicks
    .groupByKey()
    .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(5)))
    .count()
    .toStream()
    .to("user-activity-counts");
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
```
Optimal Batch Size = √(2 × Network_RTT × Event_Rate / Holding_Cost)
                   = √(2 × 1ms × 8,333 / 0.1ms) ≈ 408 events

Recommended: 4KB batch size for optimal latency/throughput balance
```

## Key Metrics
- **Throughput**: 100,000+ events/second
- **Latency**: <100ms end-to-end (95th percentile)
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime
- **Processing Efficiency**: 95% of events processed successfully

## Benefits
- **Real-time Insights**: Immediate business intelligence
- **Personalization**: Dynamic user experience optimization
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with partition addition
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic failover and data replication
